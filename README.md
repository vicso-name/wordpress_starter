<p>This guide helps you to implement the Gulp starter to your WordPress project. Just follow the step by step instructions below:</p>

<h3>Step 1</h3>

<p>Install WordPress on a web host or on the locally.</p>

<h3>Step 2</h3>

<p> Clone <code>git clone  https://github.com/vicso-name/wordpress_starter.git</code> the Gulp starter to a wp-content folder of your project.</p>

<h3>Step 3</h3>

<p>Go to the starter folder, and run the command line from this folder. Use the <code>npm i</code> for initializing a node_modules.</p>

<h3>Step 4</h3>

<p>While node_modules library are being installed let's create the starter WordPress template. You can use the <a href="https://underscores.me/" rel="nofollow"></a> for this purpose.</p>
<p>In this step, we need to create an extra folder in our starter theme: named css and inside the css folder we need to create the sass folder with main.sass inside. And in the js folder (no need to to create it, the underscores generator created it already for us) we have to create the app.js file.</p>
